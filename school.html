		<h2>Founded</h2>
		<p>In 1955, Cerritos College is one of the top 
		community colleges in Los Angeles County offering 
		comprehensive, high-quality, affordable education and 
		career training. We are one of the five largest 
		community colleges in Los Angeles County. We sit on 
		135 acres located in the City of Norwalk, near the 
		intersection of Interstates 5, 605, and 105, and 
		State Route 91. This makes the campus geographically 
		convenient for students coming from Southeastern 
		Los Angeles County and North Orange County. The 
		District serves the cities of Artesia, Bellflower, 
		Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood, La Mirada, 
		Long Beach, Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs, and 
		South Gate. An average of 22,000 students attend 
		annually, and participate in over 180 areas of study 
		and 87 degree and certificate programs. </p>
